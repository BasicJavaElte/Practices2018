### How things work here...

Our material is public and available for anyone learning. The classes are exclusive for the students registered at ELTE.

You're kindly requested to contact me only using the official channels, unless you want to invite me for partying, then you can use whatever ;)

* Everything here has only **educational purposes**;
* Anyone is very much welcome to send pull requests;
  * Only students of this course will get **extra points** tho...
* Pull requests will be evaluated by the lecturer;
* Pull requests with unnecessary files or misleading documentation will be commented and may be refused.

## What if I am a student of the course?
Even better, let's remember some stuff then...

### Course rules
* Presence is mandatory, remember to sign the presence sheet every class. If you fail on doing so, 3 unjustified absences automatically fails you.
  * **But I was traveling** Good for you :) But unless you have some justification that is just another absence;
  * **But I was sick** Send a proof of it to the lecturer e-mail;
  * **But I really needed to skip the class** Send your justification to the lecturer's e-mail and the course team will evaluate it, we are not so cold hearted.
  * **But I arrived super late in the semester** Once again, send it to the lecturer, this information will be verified with the university administration and the course team will decide case by case.
  * **But I was about to sign the presence sheet then I got distracted by a gnome that was passing by the classroom, passed the sheet on and forgot to sign it by the end of the class even though it was there all the time.** Really? OMG! Fortunately you have 3 absences.


* **NO IDEs** We will try to work together and learn first how to do things from scratch, compiling and running from the console.

### Copies, plagiarism and similars
Any sort of plagiarism, copies, ideological falsehood  or unlawful behavior may be subject of auction in the format of the university regulations.

#### Course grades
* Challenges and class exercises (20%)
* Final assignment (30%)
* Exam (50%)

* Accepted pull requests can count as extra points in all the activities with grades, being that these points will never compose more than 30% of the grade.
  * The extra points will first be attributed to the challenges, then to the final assignment and only if all those are with full mark, to the final exam.

* During the exam period, the highest grade is taken
* There is no *cum laude* grade
